# Pagination
Created based on project from Teamtreehouse.com. If you are also student and 
working on this or a similar project, feel free to reach out to me with any
questions about this code. I've made an effort to include helpful comments and
documentation for fellow learners. 

## Basic Structure

'Pagination' is a simple vanilla javaScript application to take a list of
users provided via a HTML document and paginate them into groups of 10 users. 

### Concepts Demonstrated

The main teachnologies and concepts demonstrated in this project are

* Vanilla javaScript
* Progressive Enhancement - having javascript turned on adds to accessibility,
  but is not required for site to function.
